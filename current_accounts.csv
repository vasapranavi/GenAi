It’s intended mainly for short-term costs or emergencies and isn’t generally suitable for longer-term borrowing. There is a cost associated with using an overdraft. The way you manage your overdraft, for example if you don’t repay your interest and charges regularly, may affect your credit file. This could make it harder or more expensive to get credit with us or other providers in the future. Find out more about OverdraftsOverdrafts depend on your circumstances and you must repay any overdraft when we ask in line with our General Terms and Conditions. We may ask you to repay all or part of your overdraft at any time but we'll try to notify you of this in advance.An arranged overdraft is when we let you borrow up to a pre-agreed limit – you can ask for one when you open your account or at any other time.An unarranged overdraft occurs when your account goes overdrawn without an arranged overdraft in place or if your account goes over your arranged overdraft limit.When you try to make a payment that would take you into an unarranged overdraft, we make the decision whether to allow or reject the payment based on your individual circumstances. If we allow a payment, it will take you into an unarranged overdraft. We don’t charge fees for allowing or refusing a payment due to lack of funds. Am I eligible? How much will it cost? Is the eligibility checker right for me?Already completed the eligibility checker?

Trustees must be aged 18 or over, have parental responsibility for the child and have a Santander personal current account. After opening the account, the trustee must manage the account on behalf of the child.Remember, as a trustee you’ll need to bring some proof of your name and address and your child’s name. See a list of acceptable identificationWhen the child reaches age 11, the trustee can choose:To hand over the account to the childTo transfer money out of the account before handing over control and ownership, so the trustee can decide how much money the child has access toTo continue to manage the account until the child is 18 years oldTo remove the trust status from an existing account, the trustee must visit us in a branch with the child. For new account openings, the trust status can be removed for all children aged 11 and over the day after account opening.Accounts cannot be opened in trust for children aged 13 or over. Young people aged 13 and olderFrom the age of 13 to 17, young people must open and manage a 1|2|3 Mini Current Account themselves. Young people can open a 1|2|3 Mini account up until their 18th birthday.The account automatically transfers to an adult current account after the holder’s 19th birthday if it hasn’t been transferred to a different Santander current account before this time. Before transferring the account to an adult account we’ll give 2 months’ notice. The General Terms & Conditions for Current Accounts and Savings Accounts will continue to apply together with any specific conditions in the Key Facts Document for the new account (which we’ll provide to you at the time).If the trust status isn’t removed by the time the young person is 18, the interest rate on the account will change to 0.10% AER/gross (variable), unless we notify you otherwise. At this point, the account can't be transferred to another account in our range but the young person can apply for an adult current account in their own name. We’ll get in touch with more information near the young person’s 18th birthday.
